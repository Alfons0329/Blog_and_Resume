# leetcode_OJ WC146 Report and some notes
These days I usually write the solution report on leetcode official website more than my own github website, serving as a path to communicate with pro algorithmic coders and exchange the ideas throughout the world.

## PA. [1128. Number of Equivalent Domino Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-equivalent-domino-pairs/)
* Approach: Use pair and let the smaller value always at the front, then C(i, 2) for combinations of 2 in i same dominoes group
* Analysis:
    * Time complexity: O(N)   
    * Space complexity: O(N) for storing the results  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numEquivDominoPairs(vector<vector<int>>& d) 
    {
        int res = 0, n = d.size();
        map<pair<int, int>, int> m;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if(d[i][0] > d[i][1])
            {
                m[make_pair(d[i][1], d[i][0])]++;                
            }
            else
            {
                m[make_pair(d[i][0], d[i][1])]++;                
            }
        }
        auto it = m.begin();
        while(it != m.end())
        {
            if(it -> second > 1)
            {
                res += (it -> second) * (it -> second - 1) / 2 ;
            }
            it++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
