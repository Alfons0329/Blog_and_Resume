# leetcode_OJ WC143 Report and some notes
These days I usually write the solution report on leetcode official website more than my own github website, serving as a path to communicate with pro algorithmic coders and exchange the ideas throughout the world.

## PA. [1103. Distribute Candies to People](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-candies-to-people/)
* Thought: Intuitive implmentation
* Analysis:
    * Time complexity: O(N)   
    * Space complexity: O(N) for storing the results  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> distributeCandies(int candies, int num_people) 
    {
        vector<int> res(num_people);
        int idx = 0, cnt = 1;
        while(candies)
        {
            res[idx % num_people] += (candies > cnt) ? cnt : candies;
            candies = (candies > cnt) ? candies - cnt : 0;
            cnt++;
            idx++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
