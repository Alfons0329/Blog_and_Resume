## RSA Encryption standard

* Asymmetric encryption standard.
This encryption standard mainly focus on prime factorization

### Course project1. Chosen cipher attack
* Will post report after the session of this homework ends.

## DES Encryption standard
* An encryption algorithm use round, permutation shift and XOR operation to generate the ciphertext.

* Prone to brute force attack since the key space is too small to guarantee the safe area, so the safer 3-DES algorithm is used nowadays.

## From DES to 3DES
