# Microprocessor Lab Final Project

* Course Introduction <br />
This course mainly focus on the embedded system understanding, and we use the ARM microarchitecture in this semester.

* Goal of this course <br />
To briefly understand the ARM Assembly, how to write C code in the embedded developing board and make a small project from it by your own.

* Embedded board spec:<br />
1.Nucleo STM32L476RG ARM Microarchitecture <br />
2.Built-in 400MHz CPU (customizable frequency with internal clock settings provided) <br />
3.GPIO Available <br />
[Detailed specs](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32l476rg.html) <br />

* Lab project and final project <br />
There are 10 labs in this semester on a weekly basis, the first five focus on basic operation of ARM Assembly, namely the lab assignments are
typically written in the ARM Assembly, while the last five labs are written in C language, but a embedded-like C language.


## About my final project

* Project name: The RGB Ambient light. <br />
* Features: <br />
1.Fully-customizable RGB proportion control. <br />
2.Color cycle speed controller (faster->original)<br />
3.Light-sensitive resistor ADC ,detecting the background light for light quantity settings<br />

## Part0. Preparation and the origin of this idea.

I once have the fully-customizable dynamic RGB LED backlit keyboard [SteelSeries APEXM 650](https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-m650)


## Part1. Circuit connection


## Part2. Key factor of this project

The PWM,
(c code here)

## Part3. It's time to change the color.

## Part4. More idea: the ADC of light-sensitive resistor
