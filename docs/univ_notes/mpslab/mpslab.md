# Microprocessor Lab Final Project
* Course Introduction
This course mainly focus on the embedded system understanding, and we use the ARM microarchitecture in this semester.
* Embedded board spec: Nucleo STM32L476RG ARM Microarchitecture <br />
1.Built-in 400MHz CPU (customizable frequency with internal clock settings provided) <br />
2.GPIO Available <br />
* Lab project and final project
There are 10 labs in this semester on a weekly basis, the first five focus on basic operation of ARM Assembly, namely the lab assignments are
typically writen in the ARM Assembly, while the last five labs are written in C language, but a embedded-like C language.

* Project name: The RGB Ambient light. <br />
* Features: <br />
1.Fully-customizable RGB porprotion control. <br />
2.Color cycle speed controller (faster->original)<br />
3.Light-sensitive resistor ADC ,detecting the background light for light quantity settings<br />

## Part0. Preparation and the origin of this idea.

I once have the fully-customizable RGB LED backlit keyboard [SteelSeries APEXM 650]()

## Part1. Circuit connection


## Part2. Key factor of this project

The PWM,
(c code here)

## Part3. It's time to change the color.

## Part4. More idea: the ADC of light-sensitive resistor
