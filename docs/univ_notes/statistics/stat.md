## Ch3. Random variables and Probability Distributions

### Random variables
* Definition: A r.v. $X$ is called random if it outcome follows the rule of random.

## Ch4. Decision making for single sample
###Concept correction
* (From stackoverflow)
$σ$ is the population standard deviation, which is generally unknown. Typically, $X$ (a capital letter) represents a value from the population. This is a random variable (it could take any of , typically, many values). A particular value of X is called ${x}$ (lower case) and has a definite value. If you have n different such sample values you might label them $x_1,x_2,...,x_n.$ The average of n values from the population is also a random variable $\overline{X}$ and it in turn might have a particular value for n particular sample values, $\overline{x}$. Given a random sample average $\overline{X}$, that sample will have a random sample standard deviation $S$. A particular value for this random variable for a known sample of $n$ values is then $S$. The random variable $\overline{X}$ for n sample values has a smaller standard deviation than the original $X$ variable. Its population standard deviation is $σ_X¯ = σ \over \sqrt{n}$ with sample standard deviation $s_x¯=s \over\sqrt{n}.$
### Part3. Hypothesis testing
* $H_0$ is the null hypothesis that the researcher want to overthrow(?) **We want to test this one**
* $H_1$ is the alternative hypothesis that the researcher want to gather the proofs and prove it(?) **We want to test this one**
* We test a null hypothesis that is if there exist a (set) of sample that we can overthrow the null hypothesis and thus choose to support the alternative hypothesis.
* Hypothesis testing parameters: $\mu ,p ,\sigma$
* Procedure $H1$ the hypothesis of the researcher(研究者的假說) and for its converse is $H0$ () <br />
ex:<br />工人生產的燈泡壽命小於25000小時(虛無假說與對立假說不能放統計量，因為我們有興趣的是母體$\mu$而不是樣本$\overline{X}$) <br/>
ans:<br /> $H_1: \mu_{night} < 25000hrs  , and  ,  H_0: \mu_{night} \geq 25000$
